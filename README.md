# Code Examples
These are sharable examples of code that I write.

# ChickenClass
This code shows my experience with abstraction, inheritance, unit-testing, git setup, and composer setup. You can complete the tests below to validate the code. All of these tests assume that you are in the `code-example/ChickenClass` directory. Please also run `composer install` before running these tests.

  **Run Unit Tests**
  
    `./vendor/bin/phpunit ./Tests/`
  
  **Inspect Coding Standards (PSR-2)**
  
    `./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=psr2 ./App/`
